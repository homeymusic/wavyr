### Rational Signals and Rational Spectra

When we transform a traveling wave from the physical domain to the spectral domain, uncertainty is introduced. Gabor described this limit in the time-frequency dimension as $\Delta t \Delta \omega \geq \frac{1}{2}$. Rational fractions in a signal provide valuable insights into wave structures, but they are often difficult to find or feel arbitrary. In our new method, we combine transform uncertainty with the power of rational fractions. We use the infinite complete binary Stern-Brocot tree to locate rational fractions within the bounds of uncertainty so that we can create parameter-free rational approximations for any signal or spectra. This process, the Stern-Brocot Fourier Transform, offers a fresh perspective on signal processing and spectral analysis.

**The Stern-Brocot Fourier Transform:**

*Time-Frequency Domain*

$$
\phi(\omega) = Q_{SB}(\omega, \Delta t \Delta \omega) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(t) e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
$$
*Space-Wavenumber Domain*


$$
\phi(k) = Q_{SB}(k, \Delta x \Delta k) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x) e^{-i k x} \, dx
$$

**The Inverse Stern-Brocot Fourier Transform:**

*Time-Frequency Domain*

$$
\psi(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty Q_{SB}(\omega, \Delta t \Delta \omega) \phi(\omega) e^{i \omega t} \, d\omega
$$
*Space-Wavenumber Domain*

$$
\psi(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty Q_{SB}(k, \Delta x \Delta k) \phi(k) e^{i k x} \, dk
$$

#### Uncertainty Principles

*Time-Frequency Uncertainty:*

$$
\Delta t \Delta \omega \geq \frac{1}{2}
$$

*Space-Wavenumber Uncertainty:*

$$
\Delta x \Delta k \geq \frac{1}{2}
$$

*Combined Time-Frequency and Space-Wavenumber Uncertainty:*

$$
\Delta t \Delta \omega \Delta x \Delta k \geq \frac{1}{4}
$$
