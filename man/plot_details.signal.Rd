\title{Plot Detailed Signal for a Spectrum}
\usage{
plot_details.signal(x, title = "", number_of_cycles = 3, resolution = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A spectrum object.}

\item{title}{A string specifying the title of the composite wave plot. Defaults to "Detailed Signal Plot".}

\item{number_of_cycles}{A numeric value specifying the number of cycles to display in the coordinate range. Defaults to 5.}

\item{resolution}{An integer specifying the number of points sampled within the coordinate range for plotting. Defaults to 1000.}
}
\value{
A combined plot using \code{cowplot::plot_grid}, with the composite wave on top and individual component plots below.
}
\description{
This function generates a detailed visualization of a spectrum's signal, including:
\itemize{
\item A composite wave plot that combines all components of the spectrum.
\item Individual plots for each component of the spectrum.
The plots are aligned to the same coordinate range, derived from the number of cycles of the spectrum's fundamental cycle length.
}
}
\details{
The function uses \code{signal()} to generate the composite wave and individual component signals. Each plot uses the same coordinate range, ensuring visual consistency across all plots. The composite wave plot is displayed on top, followed by individual component plots in order of the components' indices.
