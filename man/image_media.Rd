\title{Create an Image Media Object}
\usage{
image_media(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A file path (character string) pointing to the image media file.
The file must exist and be a valid format supported by \code{imager::load.image}.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{"image_media"} containing:
- \code{original_image}: The original media content.
- \code{original_dimensions}: Dimensions of the original image (height, width, depth, channels).
- \code{idealized_spectrum}: The FFT of the grayscale version of the image.
- \code{idealized_dimensions}: Dimensions of the idealized image (after inverse FFT).
- \code{idealized_signal}: The inverse FFT result of the idealized spectrum.
- \code{idealized_image}: The reconstructed image after applying the inverse FFT.
- \code{idealized_spatial_frequencies}: A matrix mapping each cell to its spatial frequency values (x, y).
- \code{rationalized_spatial_frequencies}: A matrix where each cell contains a rational approximation of y / x.
- \code{gabor_filtered_image}: A method to generate Gabor-filtered images.
}
\description{
The \code{image_media} function creates an S3 object representing an image media file.
This object stores the original image, its idealized spectrum (FFT), the inverse
FFT result (idealized signal), the idealized image after inverse FFT, and methods
for Gabor filtering and spatial frequency mappings.

# Example usage:
image_file <- "path/to/image.png"
image_media_obj <- image_media(image_file)
